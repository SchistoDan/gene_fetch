# gene_fetch
A Python tool for retrieving protein and/or gene sequences from NCBI databases. The script can fetch both protein and nucleotide sequences for a given gene across multiple taxa, with support for traversing taxonomic hierarchies when sequences aren't available at the given taxonomic level (dictated by input taxid).
